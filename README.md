ui
==

A flexible standard for user interactions to be used in window frameworks and widgets libraries

## Goals

* Replace existing structure in [Piston](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/piston/)
* Serve as foundation for [Conrod](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod)
* Hopefully other window back-ends in Rust
