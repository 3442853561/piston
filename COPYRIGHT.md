          |                |                 |       1 for group        |
          |                |                 | else:                    |
          |                |                 |       1 per person       |

A vote for group counts as 1 copyright holder, to not reduce the rights of
copyright holders who made contributions before this date.

If you disagree with these terms, you must state this explicitly on each
pull request before merging.

These rules are designed for formalizing a practice of 95% consensus when
making a license change to a project, but has not been tried in court.
It helps making important license changes practical for projects with many
contributors over long periods of time.

Thanks for reading!
