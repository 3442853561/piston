### PistonDevelopers COPYRIGHT Notice

When anyone wants to change the license of Piston, the contributors must be
contacted. When contributors vote for a license change, there must be 100%
agreement, or the code authored of those who disagree needs to be rewritten.

When a contributor can not be contacted, for example by being passed away,
there is a practice of letting a majority of the contributors decide, usually
95%. This kind of practice has not been tried in court, and represents a legally
gray area. Therefore, this agreement formalizes this voting practice, but
without changing the rights of previous contributors.

By contributing to this project after

    2016-05-29

you lend your vote to the majority of

    95%, rounded up to nearest whole person

of the ACTIVE CONTRIBUTORS to apply a future license change.

ACTIVE CONTRIBUTOR is contributor who responds to a request for license
change within a time limit of 90 days (approximately 3 months).

For contributions before this date, nothing changes.

Here is a diagram explaining when copyright holder is for person or group:

```
           _____________________________________________________________
          | 100% agreement | > 95% agreement | > 3 months               |
          |----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
default   | 1 per person   | 1 per person    | 1 per person             |
          |----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
lend vote | 1 per person   | 1 for group     | if 100% agreement:       |
          |                |                 |       1 per person       |
          |                |                 | else if > 95% agreement: |
          |                |                 |       1 for group        |
          |                |                 | else:                    |
          |                |                 |       1 per person       |
          |----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
```

A vote for group counts as 1 copyright holder, to not reduce the rights of
copyright holders who made contributions before this date.

If you disagree with these terms, you can open up an issue
[here](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston/issues).

These rules helps making important license changes practical for projects with many
contributors over long periods of time.
